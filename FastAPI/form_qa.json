1934 Exchange Act or ii the proxy rules under Section 20 of the Investment Company Act 17 CFR 270 20a 1 then the provisions of those regulations shall apply in all respects to the submission except

10 a of the Securities Act Part B relates to the Statement of Additional Information SAI that must be provided upon request to recipients of the prospectus Part C relates to other information that is required to be in the registration statement 3 Part A The Prospectus The purpose of the prospectus is to provide essential information about the registrant and the transaction in a way that will assist investors in making informed decisions about whether to purchase the securities being offered Because investors who rely on the prospectus may not be sophisticated in legal or financial matters care should be taken that the information in the prospectus is set forth in a clear concise and understandable manner Extensive use of technical or legal terminology or complex language and the inclusion of excessive detail may make the prospectus difficult for many investors to understand and may therefore detract from its usefulness Accordingly registrants should adhere to the following guidelines in responding to the items in Part A l Responses to these items particularly those that call for a brief description should be as simple and direct as possible and should include only information needed to understand the fundamental characteristics of the registrant Brevity is particularly import ant in describing practices or aspects of the registrant s operations that do not differ materially from those of other investment companies 2 Descriptions of practices that are necessitated or otherwise affected by legal requirements should generally not include detailed discussions of the law 3 Responses to those items that use terms such as list or identify should include only a minimum explanation of the matters being listed or identified 4 The so called President s Letter which provides a summary of the proposed transaction may be used as the initial or introductory document to the Part A prospectus Part B Statement of Additional Information Part B of the Registration Statement consists of additional information about the registrant and the company being acquired and certain financial information that the Commission has concluded is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to require in the prospectus if the registrant complies with certain conditions The SAI or information in response to Item 6 of Form N 14 need not be included in the prospectus or accompany it when sent to shareholders provided that 1 the prospectus is sent by first class mail or any other means designed to assure reasonably prompt delivery or given to prospective investors at least 20 business days prior to a the date on which the meeting of security holders is held or b if no meeting is held the earlier of the date of the vote consent or authorization the date the transaction is consummated or the date the securities are purchased or c in the case of an exchange offer subject to the tender offer rules the scheduled expiration date of the offer 2 the cover page of the prospectus or proxy statement in the case of a prospectus in the form of a proxy statement states that the SAI is available upon oral or written request and without charge if the registrant has a toll free telephone number for use by prospective investors that number must be provided in addition a self addressed card for requesting the SAI must also accompany the prospectus unless the toll free telephone number is provided and 3 if a request for the SAI is received by the registrant the statement must be sent within one business day of receipt of the request and must be sent by first class mail or other means designed to ensure equally prompt delivery The statutory provisions relating to the dating of the prospectus apply equally to the dating of the SAI for purposes of Rule 423 under the Securities Act 17 CFR 230 423 Furthermore the SAI should be made available to investors as of the same time that the prospectus becomes

the conflict minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country as defined by paragraph d 1 of this item or are from recycled or scrap sources as defined by paragraph d 6 of this item b Based on its reasonable country of origin inquiry if the registrant determines that its necessary conflict minerals did not originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country or did come from recycled or scrap sources or if it has no reason to believe that its necessary conflict minerals may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country or if based on its reasonable country of origin inquiry the registrant reasonably believes that its necessary conflict minerals did come from recycled or scrap sources the registrant must in the body of its specialized disclosure report under a separate heading entitled Conflict Minerals Disclosure disclose its determination and briefly describe the reasonable country of origin inquiry it undertook in making its determination and the results of the inquiry it performed Also the registrant must disclose this information on its publicly available Internet website and under a separate heading in its specialized disclosure report entitled Conflict Minerals Disclosure provide a link to that website c Alternatively based on its reasonable country of origin inquiry if the registrant knows that any of its necessary conflict minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country and are not from recycled or scrap sources or has reason to believe that its necessary conflict minerals may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country and has reason to believe that they may not be from recycled or scrap sources the registrant must exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of its conflict mineral as discussed in paragraph c 1 of this item that conforms to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework if such a framework is available for the conflict mineral If as a result of that due diligence the registrant determines that its conflict minerals did not originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country or the registrant determines that its conflict minerals did come from recycled or scrap sources a Conflict Minerals Report is not required but the registrant must disclose its determination and briefly describe in the body of its specialized disclosure report under a separate heading entitled Conflict Minerals Disclosure the reasonable country of origin inquiry and the due diligence efforts it undertook in making its determination and the results of the inquiry and due diligence efforts it performed Also

include but not be limited to an independent private sector audit of the Conflict Minerals Report that is conducted in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States and certified pursuant to paragraph c 1 ii B of this item which shall constitute a critical component of the registrant s due diligence in establishing the source and chain of custody of the necessary conflict minerals A The objective of the audit of the Conflict Minerals Report is to express an opinion or conclusion as to whether the design of the registrant s due diligence measures as set forth in and with respect to the period covered by the registrant s Conflict Minerals Report is in conformity with in all material respects the criteria set forth in the nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework used by the registrant and whether the registrant s description of the due diligence measures it performed as set forth in the Conflict Minerals Report with respect to the period covered by the report is consistent with the due diligence process that the registrant undertook B The registrant s Conflict Minerals Report must include a statement that the registrant has obtained an independent private sector audit of the Conflict Minerals Report which shall constitute an audit certification C As part of the Conflict Minerals Report the registrant must identify the independent private sector auditor of the report if the auditor is not identified in the audit report and provide the audit report prepared by the auditor in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States iii Any registrant that manufactures products or contracts for products to be manufactured that are DRC conflict undeterminable as defined in paragraph d 5 of this item must disclose the steps it has taken or will take if any since the end of the period covered in its most recent prior Conflict Minerals Report

unable to determine did not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country v If a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework does not exist for a necessary conflict mineral until such a framework is developed the registrant is required to exercise appropriate due diligence in determining the source and chain of custody of the necessary conflict mineral including whether the conflict mineral is from recycled or scrap sources without the benefit of a due diligence framework If a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework becomes available for the necessary conflict mineral prior to June 30 of a calendar year the registrant must use that framework in the subsequent calendar year If the due diligence guidance does not become available until after June 30 of a calendar year the registrant is not required to use that framework until the second calendar year after the framework becomes available to provide a full calendar year before implementation If no nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework is available for a particular conflict mineral from recycled or scrap sources the due diligence inquiry regarding the conflict mineral focuses on whether the conflict mineral is from recycled or scrap sources In addition an independent private sector audit will not be required for the section of the Conflict Minerals Report pertaining to the registrant s due diligence on that recycled or scrap conflict mineral vi If the registrant

II of Form X 17A 5 Report the total number of public customer transactions executed on a national securities exchange If basisof count is an actual count place a 1 in actual box If statistical method is used place a 1 in estimate box A transaction is defined as an executed trade which results in a customer trade confirmation Therefore the count of transactions should be taken from the customer side and should not include confirmation corrections For count purposes several executions at the same price which result in one confirmation should be counted as one transaction For investment company securities transactions in which cash or securities are handled by respondent exclude transactions by others such as voluntary or period payment plans a count of trade confirmations should be used to obtain the transaction count The street and customer side are counted as one transaction For underwriting transactions the takedown should be counted as one transaction and the ultimate sale to customers should be counted based on customers confirmations e g an underwriting of 2 000 shares is ultimately sold to five customers takedown of 2 000 shares counts as one trade and the sale to five customers counts as five trades For commodity transactions purchase or sale of contracts are to be counted as one transaction and each subsequent closeout is to be counted as one transaction e g five contracts of a commodity purchased in one trade same price and on the same day is one transaction subsequent sale is five separate contracts different day or price for each is five additional transactions Do not include clearing house side in count For option transactions the purchase of an option contract represents a transaction For commercial paper transactions both the purchase and sale should be counted as separate transactions Count may be taken from confirmation or acknowledgement tickets Items which are not strictly principal trades such as private placement sales should be included Repurchase agreement sales and returns should also be included in count Corrections shall be excluded from the transaction count However an error transaction that is a transaction where the wrong security was purchased and the correct security must later be purchased is not considered a correction For error transactions the original transaction and the buy and sell from the error account are to be counted as separate transactions Firms carrying public customer accounts for other broker dealers on a fully disclosed basis are to include transactions from those accounts in their number count Firms introducing accounts on a fully disclosed basis will report zero for these items Although an actual count of transaction is preferred an estimated count may be generated using the following methodology 1 Select specific days for which transactions will be counted a Randomly selecting one of the first 15 working days in the year as the starting date b Selecting each 8 th working date thereafter throughout the entire year c Listing these dates in chronological order This should result in a list of exactly 30 dates If more than this number have been selected randomly discard dates throughout the year until only 30 remain 19a b c Report whether respondent directly or indirectly controls is controlled by or under common control with a U S bank If the answer is yes provide
